## 🛠️ Features and Technologies  
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear domain, data, and presentation layers.  
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.  
- **Dagger Hilt**: Simplified dependency injection for modular and testable code.  
- **Flow**: Reactive streams for managing asynchronous data flows.  
- **Coroutines**: Simplified asynchronous programming for clean and efficient background operations.  
- **Room Database**: Local persistence layer for managing structured data.  
- **Retrofit**: Simplified HTTP client for REST API communication.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clean-arch-android-example.git  
   ```  
2. Open the project in Android Studio.  
3. Build and run the application on an emulator or device.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **Domain Layer**: Contains use cases and core business logic.  
- **Data Layer**: Handles API calls, database operations, and data sources.  
- **Presentation Layer**: UI and ViewModel implementation using Jetpack Compose and MVVM.  

## 🧪 Testing  
The project includes unit tests for use cases and ViewModels to ensure reliability and correctness.
